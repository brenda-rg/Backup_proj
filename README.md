## Project Description

 A task scheduler is an interesting project idea for our team to build because we utilize some form of schedule on a daily basis. We all have some form of improvement we would like to see from our task scheduler and we feel the most invested in this topic. We are looking for something that is better tailored for juggling our schedules, while also still being a robust software that anyone can use.

## Code/Tools used in development
 C++, Visual Studio Code, Git, Valgrind, Vim, Github, Cmake, Sqlite Tools, Miro

## Inputs & Outputs
 Inputs: Some of the inputs include: The user will be able to enter the specific event that they wants to modify/add, the due dates of the events, the action they want to make, type of event they want to add (tag).

 Outputs: Some Outputs include: The program will have the option of printing whole schedule in the terminal, printing due dates and task, printing event times from the schedule in the terminal, or printing specified list/sublist in the program.

## Features
This program will provide the ability to add custom tags for tasks in terms of importance, input test dates and important events and automatically update the calendar. It also allows the user to sort the list alphabetically, chronologically, or by priority of the tasks if available. It also alows for users to edit or delete tasks.

## User Interface Specification

### Navigation Diagram
![User Navigation Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129914485/236547397-c2e2ad40-c8bc-43a8-b3f8-447914ab99c4.jpg)
The drawn illustration demonstrates how the user will navigate through the program as itâ€™s executed. The user will run the program and come into a start menu. There, the user will have one of the 2 options, either going into the To-Do list , add a task, edit a task, delete a task, or exit the program. At that point, the user will have the ability to perform specific actions depending on the option they decide to select. The user will be able to perform actions such as adding tasks, editing tasks. The user will then be able to exit back to the start menu or exit the program.

## Class Diagram
The UML diagram includes the sequence in which our project will flow from beginning to end. Our first class will be the beginning of the program which will start with the menu_base class. In this function, we will begin the task scheduler and go into the Start_Menu class. Once we go into the Start_Menu class, we will prompt the user so that they can select the menu option they want to go in. We will then prompt the user to enter a username and password with the corresponding functions listed. The LoginMenu will be dependent on the Start_Menu function and will collect the database information from the user. The task scheduler will then go into the  UserProfiletable class that will have a vector to fill in the user table with the information inputted in the loginMenu class. The User class will then validate that the user will input a proper username and password and jump into the listCollection class where functions of different lists will be called. The user will have the ability to see the most recent list, the task list due today, and a full view of a task list. This class will jump into the Task class and TaskList where the user will be able to edit the name of the task, the date, the description, add a task or add a form with the provided functions in these classes. This class will then set flags to check what dates the task is due and then exit out of the program as prompted.

The solid principles that were applied to the new UML diagram were the single responsibility principle and the interface segregation principle. We applied SRP to our classes and applied the interface segregation principle to our task scheduler in regard to our features. These soild principles helped organize our UML and made it easier to begin working on code. 
We modified our UML so that our classes only had a signle responsibility for our task scheduler so that changes could only be made in specific code. We applied this by creating new classes and rearranging functions in the classes. By using ISP, the user can decide whether or not they want to turn on the provided features, giving them the option to costumize their scheduler rather than forcing the features to remain on. 

This new version of our UML helped us brekadown our code to simplify each class and its responsibility contained. The updated UML gave us a better understanding of how our code was going to flow in terms of the user aspect. By doing so, we were able to plan the workflow we wanted to accomplish for our sprints.

 ## Installation/Usage
To install the program:
1. Open Visual Studio Code and use this command: $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/brenda-rg/Backup_proj.git
2. now that you have cloned the repository onto your device go into your test folder: $ cd test
3. now that you have gone into the folder run: $ cmake .
4. and run: $ make
5. Now the program is compiled, to start the program run: $ bin/prog
6. Now the program will be running and you can see what your choices are so follow the program instructions.

 ## Testing
 The program was validated using googletest Unit Tests for each tested class were all compiled into one executable called runAllTests.
 Tested constructors and functions for 6 classes.
* To run tests use the command:$ cmake . 
* $ make 
* $ bin/runAllTests
